## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tuaosh/StochSim-Assignment-2.git
cd StochSim-Assignment-2
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To avoid running all experiments, the resulting data has been stored in [this drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1W834MkvyWoFxVqD4bSNxOv27d0ObJAUz/view?usp=sharing) due to size constraints. For visualizations of this data, see the [figures](/figures) folder.
